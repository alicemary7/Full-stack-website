            <p>An irregular period is when the length of your menstrual cycle falls outside the normal range. While a typical cycle lasts 28 days, anywhere from 21 to 35 days is considered normal. If your periods are consistently shorter, longer, or unpredictable, you may be experiencing irregular periods.</p>
            <p>It's important to remember that occasional irregularity is completely normal, especially during times of stress or major life changes. However, if you're concerned about your cycle, it's always best to consult with a healthcare provider.</p>
