        Understanding how hormones regulate your menstrual cycle and

      <div class="content-card">
        <h2>What is Hormonal Imbalance?</h2>
        <p>
          Hormonal imbalance occurs when there's too much or too little of a
          hormone in your bloodstream. Because hormones play a vital role in
          regulating many of your body's processes, even small imbalances can
          cause significant effects throughout your entire body.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your menstrual cycle is orchestrated by a delicate balance of
          hormones. When these hormones are out of sync, it can lead to
          irregular periods, absent periods, or other menstrual disruptions.
          Understanding the role each hormone plays is key to identifying and
          addressing imbalances.

        <h2>Causes of Hormonal Imbalance</h2>
        <p>
          Hormonal imbalances can result from various factors and conditions.
          Understanding potential causes can help you and your healthcare
          provider identify the root issue:
        </p>

        <div class="causes-list">
          <div class="cause-item">
            <strong>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)</strong>
            One of the most common causes, affecting hormone levels and leading
            to irregular periods, excess androgen production, and potential
            fertility issues.
          </div>
          <div class="cause-item">
            <strong>Thyroid Disorders</strong>
            Both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can significantly impact
            menstrual cycles and reproductive hormones.
          </div>
          <div class="cause-item">
            <strong>Chronic Stress</strong>
            Elevated cortisol levels from prolonged stress can disrupt the
            delicate balance of reproductive hormones.
          </div>
          <div class="cause-item">
            <strong>Poor Nutrition</strong>
            Inadequate nutrition, extreme dieting, or eating disorders can
            affect hormone production and regulation.
          </div>
          <div class="cause-item">
            <strong>Birth Control</strong>
            Hormonal contraceptives can alter natural hormone levels, and it may
            take time for balance to restore after stopping.
          </div>
          <div class="cause-item">
            <strong>Perimenopause</strong>
            The transition period before menopause brings natural hormonal
            fluctuations that can cause various symptoms.

    <!-- Section 4: Key Hormones -->
    <div class="section">
      <div class="content-card">
        <h2>Key Hormones in Your Menstrual Cycle</h2>
        <p>
          Several hormones work together to regulate your menstrual cycle.
          Understanding these key players can help you recognize when something
          might be off balance:
        </p>

        <h3>Estrogen</h3>
        <p>
          The primary female sex hormone responsible for the development and
          regulation of the reproductive system. It helps thicken the uterine
          lining and plays a role in bone health, cardiovascular function, and
          mood regulation.
        </p>

        <h3>Progesterone</h3>
        <p>
          Works alongside estrogen to regulate the menstrual cycle. It prepares
          the uterine lining for pregnancy and helps maintain early pregnancy.
          Low progesterone can lead to irregular periods and fertility issues.
        </p>

        <h3>Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)</h3>
        <p>
          Produced by the pituitary gland, FSH stimulates the growth of ovarian
          follicles and is essential for ovulation and reproductive health.
        </p>

        <h3>Luteinizing Hormone (LH)</h3>
        <p>
          Triggers ovulation and stimulates the production of estrogen and
          progesterone. An LH surge indicates that ovulation is about to occur.
        </p>

        <h3>Testosterone</h3>
        <p>
          While often thought of as a male hormone, women produce small amounts
          that affect libido, bone density, and muscle mass. Excess testosterone
          can cause symptoms like acne and excess hair growth.
        </p>

        <h2>Natural Ways to Support Hormonal Balance</h2>

          While medical treatment may be necessary for some conditions, these
          lifestyle approaches can help support overall hormonal health:

            <div class="tip-icon">🥗</div>
            <h4>Balanced Nutrition</h4>
            <p>
              Eat a diet rich in whole foods, healthy fats, lean proteins, and
              plenty of vegetables. Include foods high in omega-3 fatty acids
              and fiber to support hormone production and regulation.

            <h4>Regular Exercise</h4>
            <p>
              Engage in moderate physical activity to help regulate insulin
              levels, reduce stress, and maintain a healthy weight, all of which
              support hormonal balance.

            <h4>Quality Sleep</h4>
            <p>
              Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Sleep is crucial for
              hormone production and regulation, particularly for cortisol and
              melatonin.

              Practice stress-reduction techniques like meditation, yoga, deep
