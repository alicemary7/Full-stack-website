        <h2>The Connection Between Stress and Your Period</h2>
        <p>
          Your menstrual cycle is intricately connected to your overall health
          and wellbeing. When you're under stress or making significant
          lifestyle changes, your body responds by altering hormone production,
          which can directly affect your periods.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hypothalamus, a small region in your brain that regulates your
          menstrual cycle, is highly sensitive to stress, sudden weight changes,
          intense exercise, and sleep disruptions. Understanding these
          connections empowers you to take control of your menstrual health.

          <div class="impact-card">
            <h3><span class="icon">😰</span> Chronic Stress</h3>
            <p>
              High levels of cortisol (the stress hormone) can suppress
              reproductive hormones, leading to delayed, missed, or irregular
              periods. Chronic stress creates a hormonal imbalance that signals
              your body it's not an optimal time for reproduction.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="impact-card">
            <h3><span class="icon">🏃‍♀️</span> Excessive Exercise</h3>
            <p>
              While regular exercise is healthy, overtraining or very intense
              workouts without adequate recovery can disrupt your cycle.
              Athletes and fitness enthusiasts may experience amenorrhea
              (absence of periods) due to low body fat and high physical stress.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="impact-card">
            <h3><span class="icon">⚖️</span> Weight Fluctuations</h3>
            <p>
              Rapid weight loss or gain affects estrogen production. Being
              significantly underweight or overweight can cause irregular
              periods or stop them entirely. Your body needs a certain amount of
              fat to maintain regular hormone production.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="impact-card">
            <h3><span class="icon">😴</span> Poor Sleep</h3>
            <p>
              Irregular sleep patterns and insufficient sleep disrupt your
              circadian rhythm, which regulates hormone production. Night shift
              work and chronic sleep deprivation are particularly problematic
              for menstrual regularity.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="impact-card">
            <h3><span class="icon">🍔</span> Nutrition</h3>
            <p>
              Poor nutrition, restrictive dieting, or eating disorders can
              deprive your body of essential nutrients needed for hormone
              production. Both undereating and consuming a diet high in
              processed foods can impact your cycle.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="impact-card">
            <h3><span class="icon">☕</span> Caffeine & Alcohol</h3>
            <p>
              Excessive caffeine intake can increase cortisol levels and worsen
              PMS symptoms. Heavy alcohol consumption can disrupt liver
              function, affecting how your body processes hormones and
              potentially causing irregular periods.

              <h4>Manage Stress</h4>
              <p>
                Practice meditation, yoga, deep breathing, or mindfulness. Even
                10 minutes daily can reduce cortisol levels and support hormonal
                balance.

              <h4>Balanced Exercise</h4>
              <p>
                Aim for moderate exercise most days. Mix cardio with strength
                training and always include rest days. Listen to your body's
                signals.

              <h4>Maintain Healthy Weight</h4>
              <p>
                Focus on sustainable, gradual changes rather than crash diets.
                Work with a healthcare provider to determine a healthy weight
                range for your body.

              <h4>Prioritize Sleep</h4>
              <p>
                Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep. Maintain a consistent sleep
                schedule, even on weekends, and create a relaxing bedtime
                routine.

              <p>
                Eat a balanced diet rich in whole grains, lean proteins, healthy
                fats, fruits, and vegetables. Don't skip meals, especially
                breakfast.

              <p>
                Reduce caffeine and alcohol intake, especially during your
                luteal phase. Stay well-hydrated with water and herbal teas.

              <p>
                Keep a menstrual diary to identify patterns between lifestyle
                factors and your cycle. Note stress levels, exercise, sleep, and
                symptoms.

              <p>
                Connect with friends, family, or support groups. Social
                connections reduce stress and improve overall mental health.
