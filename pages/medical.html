        <h2>Common Menstrual Health Conditions</h2>
        <p>
          Many women experience menstrual health challenges at some point in
          their lives. Understanding these conditions, their symptoms, and
          treatment options is essential for taking control of your reproductive
          health and overall wellbeing.
        </p>

        <p>
          While occasional irregularities in your cycle are normal, persistent
          symptoms may indicate an underlying condition that requires medical
          attention. Early diagnosis and proper treatment can significantly
          improve your quality of life and prevent potential complications.

        <h2>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)</h2>
        <p>
          PCOS is one of the most common hormonal disorders affecting women of
          reproductive age. It affects approximately 1 in 10 women and can have
          significant impacts on fertility, metabolism, and overall health.
        </p>

        <div class="symptoms-list">
          <h4>Common Symptoms:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Irregular or absent menstrual periods</li>
            <li>Excess hair growth on face, chest, or back (hirsutism)</li>
            <li>Weight gain or difficulty losing weight</li>
            <li>Thinning hair or male-pattern baldness</li>
            <li>Acne, oily skin, or dandruff</li>
            <li>Darkening of skin in body creases and folds</li>

            <li>Fertility challenges</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Diagnosis and Testing</h3>
        <p>
          There is no single test to diagnose PCOS. Healthcare providers
          typically use a combination of:

        <h3>Treatment Options</h3>
        <p>
          While there's no cure for PCOS, symptoms can be managed through
          various approaches:
        </p>

        <!-- <div class="treatment-tabs">

                <button class="tab-button">Fertility Treatments</button>
            </div> -->

        <p>
          Treatment typically focuses on managing individual symptoms and may
          include birth control pills to regulate periods, anti-androgen
          medications, metformin for insulin resistance, and lifestyle
          modifications including diet and exercise.
        </p>

        <div class="info-box">
          <h4>💡 Important Note</h4>
          <p>
            Women with PCOS have an increased risk of developing type 2
            diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and endometrial
            cancer. Regular monitoring and maintaining a healthy lifestyle are
            crucial for long-term health.

    <!-- Section 4: Endometriosis -->
    <div class="section">
      <div class="content-card">
        <h2>Endometriosis</h2>
        <p>
          Endometriosis occurs when tissue similar to the lining of the uterus
          grows outside the uterus, commonly on the ovaries, fallopian tubes,
          and pelvic lining. This tissue responds to hormonal changes during the
          menstrual cycle, causing inflammation and pain.
        </p>

        <div class="symptoms-list">
          <h4>Common Symptoms:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Severe menstrual cramps that may worsen over time</li>
            <li>Chronic pelvic pain, especially during menstruation</li>
            <li>Pain during or after sexual intercourse</li>
            <li>Painful bowel movements or urination during periods</li>
            <li>Heavy menstrual bleeding or bleeding between periods</li>
            <li>Infertility or difficulty conceiving</li>
            <li>Fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, bloating, or nausea</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Understanding Stages</h3>
        <p>
          Endometriosis is classified into four stages based on the location,
          extent, and depth of endometrial tissue, as well as the presence of
          adhesions and cysts. Stage I is minimal, while Stage IV is severe.
          However, the stage doesn't always correlate with pain levels.
        </p>

        <h3>Treatment Approaches</h3>
        <p>
          Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms, extent of the
          condition, and whether you wish to become pregnant. Options include
          pain medications, hormonal therapies to suppress endometrial growth,
          and surgical intervention in more severe cases.
        </p>

        <div class="info-box">
          <h4>💡 Did You Know?</h4>
          <p>
            Endometriosis affects approximately 10% of women during their
            reproductive years, but diagnosis often takes 7-10 years due to
            symptom normalization and lack of awareness.

    <!-- Section 5: Heavy Menstrual Bleeding -->
    <div class="section">
      <div class="content-card">
        <h2>Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (Menorrhagia)</h2>
        <p>
          Heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as losing 80ml or more of blood
          during your period, having periods lasting longer than 7 days, or
          bleeding that significantly interferes with your daily activities.
        </p>

        <div class="symptoms-list">
          <h4>Signs You May Have Heavy Bleeding:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Needing to change pads or tampons every hour for several hours
            </li>
            <li>Needing to use double sanitary protection</li>
            <li>Waking up to change sanitary protection during the night</li>
            <li>Passing blood clots larger than a quarter</li>
            <li>Bleeding for more than 7 days</li>
            <li>Experiencing fatigue, shortness of breath, or dizziness</li>
            <li>Restricting activities due to heavy bleeding</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Possible Causes</h3>
        <p>
          Heavy menstrual bleeding can result from hormonal imbalances, uterine
          fibroids, polyps, adenomyosis, bleeding disorders, certain
          medications, or complications from IUDs. In some cases, no specific
          cause is found.
        </p>

        <h3>When to Seek Help</h3>
        <p>
          Consult your healthcare provider if heavy bleeding interferes with
          your daily life, causes anemia symptoms, or if you're concerned about
          the amount of blood loss. Early treatment can prevent complications
          and improve quality of life.
